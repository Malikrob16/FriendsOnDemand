Fixes:
-- Get user name to display properly in chat message
-- Format chat message time correctly
-- Add username request popup instead of using prompt and alert for chatbox
-- Adjust bots message timing
-- Add videos to videos.json and dynamically load them into card-grid
-- Adjust main section scale to fit middle of screen
-- Add character seats and concession stand to footer so they appear across the bottom of the screen
-- Finish dynamically loading videos from video.json and append them to card-grid
-- Have initial video cards on the projector screen be images then once the card is clicked have the entire projector be the clicked video
-- Give each json video a description and title to be loaded
-- Get video thumbnails and set them in create card function
-- Each card is a button which will open the selected video to cover the entire projector screen while keeping the character chairs over top (This will give the Mystery Science Theater 3000 styling.)
-- Fix chat box username verification
-- Make a div for character area that overlaps projector screen so that the scroll does no effect video selection. (Give character area div pointer-events: none; Stops pointer interactions)
